Beyond just being a student organization to get involved in, it gave us examples real business world problems which we would learn to understand and create a solution for. Also, we were able to reach out to actual representatives from businesses, giving us connections that could be beneficial to us in the future. Along with all of the business experiences, I developed a lifelong connection to the world of business that will impact every decision I make in my own career.” </strong> </h4>
