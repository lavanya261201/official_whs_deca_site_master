                     <h2>Requirements to be a Member</h2>
                     <p>Since DECA is a CTSO, the CA Department of Education requires all students to take a CTE course in order to be a member of DECA Inc. The CTE courses provided at Washington High School are Web Design, Marketing, Digital Video and Arts Production, and Business Entrepreneurship. If a student cannot take a CTSE course, the student can become a member of WHS DECA but cannot attend conferences like NorCal, States, and ICDC. The club will organize conferences like MiniCon for these members.</p>

                     <p>With the implementation of the New CTE Rule, DECA will be divided into two tiers: DECApprentices and DECompetitors. DECApprentinces are members who aren't enrolled in a CTE course but would like to be still be a part of WHS DECA. These members attend one conference, MiniCon,and will learn the skills used in DECA. DECompetitors are members who are enrolled in a CTE course and as a result will have the opportunity to attend the 3 main conferences: NorCal CDC, States CDC, and International CDC.</p>
