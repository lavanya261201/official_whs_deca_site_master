							<p style="text-indent: 2em">WHS DECA's competitions program takes members, through a step-by-step process in preparing and perfecting their writing skills and presentation abilities. Through several conferences, NorCal CDC, State CDC, and International CDC, members can enrich their business knowledge and utilize them outside not only in school but also in the real world.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 2em">The first task that students have to accomplish is to select an event in which they want to compete. It can often be tough to choose an event, but you can always get help from any of the officers!</p>
							<p><strong>Here are some helpful tips in selecting your event that's perfect for you:</strong></p>
							<ol type="1">
								<li><strong>Choosing the Cluster</strong><br>
								There are four basic clusters in DECA: Marketing, Hospitality and Tourism, Finance, and Business Management and Administration. Each cluster has events that revolve around the fundamental principles of its cluster’s title: events in the marketing cluster focus on marketing to consumers, those in the finance cluster center around financial aspects of maintaining a business, and so forth. Think about which area is the most appealing to you. Try researching and learning about each cluster, and then you can eliminate the clusters you’re definitely not interested in. Then, look through events that are in clusters that appeal to you.</li>
								<li><strong>Choosing the Type of Event</strong><br>
								They generally two types of events: Written and Role-Play. In WHS, we allow students to either choose one event or both types. When considering a specific event, it is important to weigh the pros and cons of both types of events. If you enjoy thinking fast and don’t mind improvising a presentation in 10 to 30 minutes – depending on the event – then role-plays are for you. However, if you prefer preparing beforehand to present but don’t mind writing anywhere from five to 30 pages, consider doing a written event. However, don’t let the thought of writing a prospectus prevent you from contemplating a written event. A little added time and effort can go a long way in helping you proceed to DECA’s International CDC.</li>
								<li><strong>Consider Chapter Events and Online Events</strong><br>
								Chapter events are written projects on a larger scale. By choosing a chapter event, you agree to represent your entire chapter. Only one person or group per chapter can do a specific chapter event. However, it is only presented at State CDC, so for NorCal CDC, you would have no written event. Chapter events are actually quite a lot of work and require planning and effort. These events also give you a chance to improve your chapter or community. In addition, there are DECA’s Online Events that provide opportunities for students to participate in online simulations to learn how to invest in the stock market, manage personal finances, or operate a business venture. Contact an officer to get a more comprehensive explanation about these special events.</li>
								<li><strong>Consider on a Personal Scale</strong><br>
								Think about how you can put a personal spin on your event. How can you take an event and make it your own? If you can think of an interesting and unique way to present a topic, and also be able to have fun with it, that event is probably perfect for you!</li>
								<li><strong>Ask an Officer</strong><br>
								If you’re still in a quandary over what to choose, reach out to us! Every officer can give suggestions on what event to choose. They will try to gauge which event suits you best.</li>
