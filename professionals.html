							<p><strong>Do you have time to assist students with their career goals?</strong>
							</p>


							<p style="text-indent: 2em;">DECA students always need your help as a competitive events judge at the DECA Career Development Conference. As a competitive events judge, you’ll sit across the table from DECA members who have been preparing all year-long in classrooms to have their chance to shine in front of you.</p>


							<ul>
								<li>They’ll share promotional strategies for a case study they just received 10 minutes ago.</li>


								<li>They’ll passionately explain how they activated their entire community to get behind an important cause.</li>


								<li>They’ll unveil a comprehensive generational marketing strategy for a local business that developed through their classroom learning.</li>


								<li>They’ll tell you about their real business and their plans to grow it over the next three years.</li>


								<li>They’ll give you innovative ideas that you can use in your own company!</li>
							</ul>


							<p style="text-indent: 2em;">There are competitions in a range of industries including advertising, entrepreneurship, fashion, finance, hospitality, international marketing, restaurant, retail, sales and more... You will then evaluate the students' performances using a brief, easy to complete evaluation form.</p>


							<p><strong>When you volunteer to judge a DECA event, you are aiding bright and motivated students in having an educational experience of a lifetime.</strong>
							</p>
